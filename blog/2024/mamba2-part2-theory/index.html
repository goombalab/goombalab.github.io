In isolation, this model is relatively simple to define, and we claimed that it can be computed either as an SSM recurrence or with an attention-like pattern. If you just want to use the model, feel free to skip this post!</p> <p>In this post, we’ll dive into the theory behind the model. We’ll derive the SSD “duality” in two completely separate ways, one starting from the SSM perspective and one from the attention perspective. Each method is actually much more broad than the SSD model itself, and the union of these two strong generalizations is what we call the SSD <em>framework</em>. This framework provides a rich body of connections between state space models, attention, and structured matrices. While the SSD model can be viewed as a specific instantiation of each prong of the framework, the SSD framework is much more general opens up many directions for future work.</p> <h4 id="the-state-space-duality-framework">The State Space Duality framework</h4> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_venn-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_venn-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_venn-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/ssd_venn.png" width="100%" height="auto" title="Structured State Space Duality" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> <figcaption class="caption">SSD Framework (red, blue): State space models (i.e. semiseparable matrices) and structured masked attention encapsulate large classes of efficient sequence models.

We call this a <em>matrix sequence transformation</em>, or matrix transformation for short. In the literature sequence transformations have also been referred to as “sequence mixers” or “token mixers”, and matrix sequence transformations as “matrix mixers”. There are many examples of these, which are distinguished by the structure of the $M$ matrix. The de facto example is self-attention itself, where $M = \mathsf{softmax}(QK^\top)$ is the attention matrix. Other examples include MLP-Mixer<d-cite key="tolstikhin2021mlp"></d-cite>, FNet<d-cite key="lee2021fnet"></d-cite>, and Monarch Mixer<d-cite key="dao2022monarch"></d-cite><d-cite key="fu2024monarch"></d-cite>.</p> <p>Why do we care about these types of models?</p> <blockquote> <p>Writing a sequence model as a matrix transformation provides a powerful tool to understand the structure and characteristics of the model.</p> </blockquote> <p>And although general non-linear RNNs such as LSTMs <em>cannot</em> be written as matrix mixers, state space models can! In fact, this is pretty easy to see by just unrolling the definition of the SSM recurrence. The upshot is that the SSM \eqref{eq:ssm-transformation} can be written as a matrix transformation</p> \[Y = \mathsf{SSM}(A, B, C)(X) = MX\] <p>where $M_{ij} = 0$ for $i &lt; j$ (i.e. it’s lower triangular) and otherwise \begin{equation} \label{eq:semiseparable} M_{ij} = C_i^\top A_{i:j}^\times B_j := C_i^\top A_i \dots A_{j+1} B_j \end{equation}</p> <p>Drawing it out, this matrix looks like</p> \[\begin{bmatrix} C_0^\top B_0 &amp; \\ C_1^\top A_1 B_0 &amp; C_1^\top B_1 &amp; \\ C_2^\top A_2A_1 B_0 &amp; C_2^\top A_2 B_1 &amp; C_2^\top B_2 \\ \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots \\ C_\mathtt{T}^\top A_{\mathtt{T}-1}\dots A_1 B_0 &amp; C_\mathtt{T}^\top A_{\mathtt{T}-1}\dots A_2 B_1 &amp; \dots &amp; C_\mathtt{T}^\top A_{\mathtt{T}-1} B_{\mathtt{T}-2} &amp; C_\mathtt{T}^\top B_{\mathtt{T}-1} \\ \end{bmatrix}\] <p>\begin{equation} \label{eq:ssm-matrix} (\text{Matrix Transformation Representation of State Space Models}) \end{equation}</p> <h3 id="semiseparable-matrices">Semiseparable Matrices</h3> <p>This type of matrix in fact has a name: it’s called a (triangular) <strong>semiseparable matrix</strong>, and has been studied in other fields of engineering and computational linear algebra<d-cite key="vandebril2005bibliography"></d-cite>. These matrices are (IMO) quite fundamental and beautiful, and the full paper talks about more of their properties.

Giving these two axes different names will make the math more clear and also covers more general forms of attention such as cross-attention, where the source and target are separate sequences with different lengths.

In this case, we can simply redefine $Q \leftarrow \psi(Q)$ and define $\mathtt{N}$ to be the <strong>feature dimension</strong> of the attention kernel to begin with. Softmax attention, for example, can be represented with a particular infinite-dimensional feature map ($\mathtt{N}=\infty$) which represents the exponential kernel.</p> </details> <p>We’ll restrict ourselves to the case when $\psi$ is finite, which is sometimes called <strong>kernel attention</strong>.

When the sequence length $\mathtt{T}$ grows and the feature dimension $\mathtt{N}$ is small—commonly, in the regime when $\psi$ is simple such as an elementwise transform and so $\mathtt{N}$ is constant—then the cost of attention can be reduced from quadratic in $\mathtt{T}$ to linear. This follows from simply computing the matrix multiplications in a different order</p> \[Y = Q \cdot (K^\top V)\] <p>This is a somewhat “folklore” interpretation of linear attention.<d-footnote>At least, one lineage of efficient attention; other varieties exist, such as those based on sparsity or hashing.

The beauty of it is that we didn’t have to write out a single summation, which was abstracted out into a tensor contraction combined with the structure of $L$.</p> <p>This immediately proves our claim about the <a href="#where-does-the-cumsum-in-linear-attention-come-from">cumsum in linear attention</a>. Moreover, this immediately reveals that the efficiency of linear attention can be made much more general…</p> <h3 id="structured-masked-attention">Structured Masked Attention</h3> <p>The critical observation is that in order for \eqref{eq:sma-lin} to be fast, all that is necessary is for $L$ to be <em>any structured matrix</em> – in other words any matrix that has subquadratic matrix-vector multiplication.</p> <p>This immediately motivates one of the main prongs of the SSD framework, which can be seen as a strong generation of LA.</p> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <h4 id="definition-structured-masked-attention">Definition: Structured Masked Attention</h4> <p><strong>Structured masked attention (SMA)</strong> is defined as the <em>four-way tensor contraction</em> \eqref{eq:sma} using an attention mask $L$ that is a structured matrix.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote class="block-tip"> <h4 id="duality-representation-2-sma">Duality Representation 2 (SMA)</h4> <p>SMA has <strong>dual quadratic and linear</strong><d-footnote>Assuming that the structured matrix $L$ has linear time matrix-vector multiplication</d-footnote> <strong>modes</strong> which are simply <em>two different pairwise reduction orders</em> \eqref{eq:sma-quad} and \eqref{eq:sma-lin}.</p> </blockquote> <p>Finally, let’s just connect this back to the commonly held view of linear attention as matrix multiplication associativity.</p> <blockquote> <p>Although it is commonly believed that incorporating attention masks $L$ prevents matrix multiplication reordering, it turns out to still be compatible.

So how fast is that? It’s not too hard to see that multiplication $y = Lx$ can be computed in linear time through a scalar recurrence:</p> \[\begin{aligned} y_0 &amp;= x_0 \\ y_1 &amp;= a_1 x_0 + a_1 \\ y_2 &amp;= a_2a_1 x_0 + a_2 x_1 + x_2 = a_2 y_1 + x_2 \\ \vdots &amp; \qquad \vdots \end{aligned}\] <p>This corresponds exactly to the original SSM recurrence!</p> <p>(In fact, multiplication by 1-SS matrices $L$ can be computed in a <em>lot</em> more ways, which we compile in the full paper! Alternative algorithms can reveal more insights: for example, the associative scan algorithm used by S5 <d-cite key="smith2023s5"></d-cite> and Mamba can also be shown to be a structured matrix multiplication algorithm on 1-SS matrices.)</p> <h3 id="going-beyond-the-ssd-layer-2">Going Beyond the SSD Layer 2</h3> <p>Structured masked attention not only helps define the SSD model and prove its duality, but it is a much broader framework of efficient attention models.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/sma-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/sma-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/sma-1400.webp 1400w," sizes="95vw" type="image/webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/2024-05-31-mamba-2/sma.png" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Prior examples include the original linear attention as well as the recent Retentive Network (RetNet) model<d-cite key="sun2023retentive"></d-cite>. These can be viewed as direct special cases of SSD. But beyond SSD, we can define classes of efficient attention by replacing the mask $L$ with <em>any structured matrix</em>. As a suggestion, we think that Toeplitz or Fourier structured attention may be interesting to consider because they might encode different forms of positional information.</p> <p>Additionally, other forms of structure can be incorporated into the $L$ mask. For example, another extension my students are developing is viewing SSD (and recurrences in general) as an algorithm operating on <em>directed line graphs</em>, and generalizing it to incorporate arbitrary graph structures.</p> <h2 id="state-space-duality">State Space Duality</h2> <p>We’ll end this post with a brief recap of what we’ve covered.</p> <p>The <strong>SSD framework</strong> consists of the two broad approaches covered in this post, which is summarized by the two areas of the [<a href="#the-state-space-duality-framework">Venn diagram</a>]:</p> <ol> <li>Viewing state space models through [<a href="#ssd-framework-1-structured-matrix-transformations">structured matrix transformations</a>]</li> <li>Generalizing linear attention through [<a href="#ssd-framework-2-structured-attention">tensor contractions</a>]</li> </ol> <p>The [<a href="#recap-the-ssd-model">SSD layer</a>] is a particular model which is the purple intersection in the figure, which can be viewed as an instance of either part of the SSD framework, and in particular has dual quadratic and linear forms that can be derived from either representation.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th><em>SSD Framework</em></th> <th>Structured SSMs</th> <th>Structured Attention</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>The main representation is…</td> <td>Structured matrix \eqref{eq:ssm-matrix} <br> sequence transformations</td> <td>The 4-way \eqref{eq:sma} <br> tensor contraction</td> </tr> <tr> <td>This generalizes…</td> <td>State space models</td> <td>Linear attention</td> </tr> <tr> <td>The SSD model is <br> an instantiation as…</td> <td>Scalar state space model <br> ($A_t$ is a scalar-identity matrix)</td> <td>1-semiseparable masked attention <br> ($L$ mask is a 1-SS matrix)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>The linear-quadratic duality is <br> revealed through…</td> <td>Structured matrix <br> multiplication algorithms</td> <td>Tensor contraction <br> reduction orderings</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="next-up">Next Up</h2> <p>In <a href="/blog/2024/mamba2-part3-algorithm/">the next part of this series</a>, we’ll see how to use some of the SSD framework (in particular, the <a href="#takeaway-computing-ssms">structured matrix algorithm</a> point of view) to derive the more efficient hybrid SSD algorithm that leverages both of the dual forms.</p> </div> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/albert.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2025 Goomba AI Lab. </div> </footer> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cloud.umami.is/script.js" data-website-id="340bca3c-b84e-462f-98dd-f4f4629b9751"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
